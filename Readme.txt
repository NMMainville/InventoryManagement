OVERVIEW
--------
This is not a game, but rather a proof-of-concept of an inventory system that was created for an assignment. Highlight a block to view its attributes. Other controls are mentioned in the solution itself.

NOTE: Only the first layer of filtering will work. The additional layers exist only to show the user how the data and filters would be handled if the solution were to be implemented.


The solution can be viewed online at this link: http://files.myfrogbag.com/bli6du/4HC3solution.swf

Built with Flixel 2.5.
